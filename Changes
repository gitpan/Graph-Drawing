Revision history for Graph::Drawing

0.01  Tue Jun 17 11:08:36 2003
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
        -A -X -n Graph::Drawing

0.01.1  Fri Jul 4 2003
    - Fixed documentation in every module.

0.01.2  Fri Jul 4 2003
    - Ack!  Forgot Graph/ under lib/.  Oops!

0.02  Fri Jul 4 2003
    - Added _debug calls here and there.
    - Added the size attribute accessor to Surface.pm.
    - Changed the G::D::Random::get_coordinate method to use the
      surface size for the max.
    - Added a line to make it obvious that you can specify the surface
      size directly, in the object creation, in the Random.pm SYNOPSIS
      and in eg/whotalks.
    - Fixed and enhanced the Drawing.pm and Surface.pm documentation.

0.03  Fri Jul 4 2003
    - Moved the base class functionality to *::Base.
    - Renamed the "pic_output" method to "draw", in Surface.pm.
    - Enhanced the documentation of Vertex.pm slightly.
    - Removed the SCALE constant from Surface.pm.
    - Made the FACTOR constant in Surface.pm an object attribute 
      called "grade".
    - Updated the Base.pm documentation accordingly.

0.4  Sat Jul 6 2003
    - Ack!  What was I thinking?  Renamed the "draw" method to
      "write_image" in Surface.pm.
    - Made the surface_name attribute optional and allowed
      write_image to accept a filename argument.
    - Holy crap.  I forgot to include Base.pm in the $#@!ing MANIFEST.
    - Made the Surface::_init method check $self->data before calling
      the max_weight method.
    - Made sure all the feeble tests ran correctly...

0.05  Wed Jul 9 2003
    - Holy crap.  I accidentally uploaded $VERSION = '0.4'; instead of
      '0.04'. shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit
    - Added documentation about why the distribution version made an
      enormous leap beyond reality.
    - Added functionality for circular and rectangular layout, grid
      and axes flag attributes to Surface.pm.
    - Remembered to add GD to the PM_PREREQS in the Makefile.PL.
    - Oof.  Didn't name G::D::Base right in the POD.
    - Added a more automated testing of a larger dataset graph to eg/.
    - Implemented the functionality for accepting an image object to
      use for the surface.
    - Added _debug methods to the Surface and Vertex modules.
    - Added POD to the Vertex, Surface and Random modules to describe
      (rather than just list) their methods.
    - Refactored code, all over.  Yes.  This is the most meaningless
      comment a programmer can make.  Fortunately, it's my embryonic
      distribution...

0.06  Thu Jul 10 2003
    - WHEW.  search.cpan.org and the CPAN shell use upload dates and
      not version numbers to determine what is "latest" - as it
      should be.  Yay!
    - Fixed documentation in the Drawing, Base, Random, and Surface
      modules.
    - Fixed the use base line in Random to actually find the parent's
      new().  Wtf didn't the previous way work on older perls?

0.07  Thu Jul 10 2003
    - Set a couple surface defaults that were just undef, previously.
    - Added display attributes to the vertex object.
    - Added conditions to check and allocate colors before every
      drawing operation.
    - Fixed up eg/whotalks to illustrate how to redraw a newly
      colored vertex.
    - Updated the SYNOPSIS of Random to show this too.
    - Changed the vertex_size and surface_size in the object, to just 
      'size', as it should be.
    - Updated documentation in the Vertex and Surface modules.

0.08  Fri Jul 11 2003
    - Removed the unused (at this time) z coordinate from Random.pm.
    - Updated and enhanced the documentation all over.
    - Excised the unnecessary =head1 ABSTRACT sections.

0.09  Thu Jul 31 2003
    - Changed the new(data=>{}) references to new(data=>{weight=>{}})
      to correspond to the updated Graph::Weighted.
    - Updated documentation here and there...
