    - Added the size attribute accessor to Surface.pm.
    - Changed the G::D::Random::get_coordinate method to use the

0.04  
    - Ack!  What was I thinking?  Renamed the "draw" method to
      "write_image" in Surface.pm.
    - Made the surface_name attribute optional and allowed
      write_image to accept a filename argument.
    - Holy crap.  I forgot to include Base.pm in the $#@!ing MANIFEST.
    - Made the Surface::_init method check $self->data before calling
      the max_weight method.
    - Made sure all the feeble tests ran correctly...
